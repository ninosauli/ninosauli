<p>
I am a dedicated Software Developer with hands-on experience in React/React Native, currently I am learning backend development through Java, exploring frameworks like Spring Boot.
<br/>
I have a Bachelor's degree focused in Informatics from Universiteti i TiranÃ«s. In the last year I have acquired valuable experiences and knowledge. My goals are to become an expert in development and
technologies related. This means not only understand the basics, but also keep up with the latest progress and best practices in the development ecosystem.
<br/>  
My adaptability and problem-solving skills are complemented by my drive for continuous learning and excellence
